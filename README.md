# Bcd-to-Excess-code-converter
The Excess-3 code:- It is an important BCD code , is a 4 bit code and used with BCD numbers To convert any decimal numbers into its excess- 3 form ,add 3 to each decimal digit and then convert the sum to a BCD number As weights are not assigned, it is a kind of non weighted codes. Binary coded decimal (BCD):-is a system of writing numerals that assigns a four-digit binary code to each digit 0 through 9 in a decimal (base-10) numeral. The four-bit BCD code for any particular single base-10 digit is its representation in binary notation, as follows: 0 = 0000. 1 = 0001. 2 = 0010.
